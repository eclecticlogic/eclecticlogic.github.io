title: SMTP-Bit - An email protocol to fight spam using Bitcoins.

### Core Idea
Email spams and spoofs are a constant nuissance for all. While filters get more and more sophisticated, the fraud perpetrators are always device new ways around it. So here is a simple proposal to put an end to spam and scam artists (or at least make it an expensive proposition). 

The proposal requires an upgrade to the email protocol which can be rolled with a deferred mandate for compliance. We will call this the SMTP-bit protocol. SMTP-bit requires email addresses to be associated with wallets. An email message is required to identify the wallet associated with the email, a signature to prove that the sender owns the wallet and the public key to the wallet. Before accepting an email, the server checks the public ledger for a transaction from the sender's wallet to the recipient's wallet (the transaction needs to transfer a minimal amount of 1 Satoshi). If it finds such a transaction, the email is accepted. Otherwise it is rejected. To make the verification of the transaction from the public ledger more efficient, the email message can include the transaction id or the receiver's mailserver can store a cache of transactions involving the recipient's wallet. The transactions can be specially tagged to make them easier to locate from the public ledger. 

With such a setup, the bitcoin transaction from party A to party B serves as a trust identifier. If party A uses a different email address, they can continue to communicate with party B based on the previously established trust relationship.

### Spammers and Spoofers
A spammer will need to send you a Satoshi before he/she can send you an unsolicited email. This makes it somewhat expensive to send out bulk emails. Upon receiving the spam, the recipient can simply add the sender's wallet to a black-list thereby prohibiting future spam.

### Domain level wallets
The protocol can be extended to allow the association of a domain-level wallet (perhaps as a TXT record in the DNS entry). This will allow corporations to establish trust with outside emails or between corporations without having to enable it on a per-email address basis. 

### High Profile Emails
The SMTP-bit protocol could also open up celebrity emails to the general public. Lets say - I'm going to pick a dead, not-generally-well-known person - Geerhardus Vos wanted his email to be publicly available but he wanted to restrict people from sending him a flood of emails. He could set up a higher transaction threshold for unknown wallets and create a white-list of wallets of his known friends and contacts (folks would then want to give a celebrity their wallet address when making an acquaintance). Nothing prevents an average Joe from setting a higher threshold either - chances are folks will not be willing to pay a higher premium to email your average Joe (or Jane!).

### Loss or compromise of Wallet
If your wallet is compromised, the situation is not too different from your email address being compromised. You simply have to ask others to black-list your old wallet and re-establish trust against your new wallet.

### Other Considerations
When all 22 million bitcoins are issued, miners will need to be supported by transaction fees. In such a setup, 1 Satoshi may not suffice. A simple solution then is to use 2 Satoshis and pay out 1 Satoshi as the transaction fee.
